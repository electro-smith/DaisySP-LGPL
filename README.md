# DaiCsP
DSP Modules derived from Csound for running on Daisy and elsewhere.

Temporary Name and Temporary README

File organization should more-or-less match that of the primary DaisySP repo

## Source

This folder should still contain subdirectories, albeit fewer with fewer modules

The modules needed can be found [here in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OH3J5840PPhrccjidPNCqra1eGA0o0Vh-rhjgUM5Cqs/edit#gid=0)

## ci

Should be able to copied as-is. Since the folder structure is staying the same everything should still _just work_.

I don't think CI will work until we make it public. Just something to be aware of.

## doc

same, should just work (generated anyway)

We will have to set up the github page, but I can take care of that once we're ready to make it public.

## resources 

this folder can be copied as well, though I'm not sure how much if it is actually still being used. Might be worth cleaning it up in both places at some point.

## util 

again, no harm  in grabbing everything here.

## vs

This _should_ still work but will need some editing/trimmming of the DaisySP modules that aren't migrating.

## Root level

the other root level files should all be able to stay. 

The CMakeLists.txt and Makefile should require some editing but will still work. 

## Other

Keep in mind there are a few open PRs on DaisySP that I will merge before this goes public so we'll want to update those.
